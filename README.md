`gh-contribution-mate` is a GitHub CLI extension that allows developers to
synchronize their local or non-github repository commits to GitHub. It is a
robust tool designed for developers who want to showcase their contributions
graphically in stats and on the contribution chart, irrespective of where the
commits were originally made.

Developed using ü¶ï [Deno](https://deno.com/runtime) with TypeScript and compiled
to executables. The tool maintains the confidentiality of the original commits.
It only syncs the timestamp and original commit hash as the commit message,
creating empty commits to prevent code leakage.

## üîí Usage At Work

`gh-contribution-mate` is completely safe to use at work. However, the tool
should be used responsibly. In the case of potential company policy conflicts,
it is advised to consult with your company or IT department before use.

## üöÄ Getting Started
